# python-p2p

A totaly decentralized python peer to peer network.

The code provides a simple network structure for information exchange between peers.

Using https://github.com/gryphius/port-forward for port forward by upnp.

# Install
note: tested on python 3.8+

To install the package do:
```
python setup.py install
```

## Implementing your own projects

### Import
You can import the module after installing by:
`import pythonp2p`

### Start
Firstly you need to initialize the node and then start it:
  node = pythonp2p.Node()
  node.start()

Advanced arguments:
`host`: The host where the socket run on. Default is "". Dont touch this if you dont have a weird network config.
`port`: the port where the nodes communicate. Default 65432
`file_server_port`: the port which the server for file transfer is listening on. It is optional. Default 65433

### Connection
To connect to a another node do:
`node.connect_to(ip)`

  `ip`: The other nodes ip. After this all other known peers to the other node will be sent to you to connect to.
  This is automatic.

`node.savestate()` save curent peers to a file.
  `file`: optional arg filename to save state to, default: state.json

`node.loadstate()` connect to previously discovered peers.
  `file`: optional arg filename to save state to, default: state.json

Note: You can also specify a `port` but it is not recommended since all of the network must run on the same port.

### Communication
To send data to the network you can do:
`node.send_message(data, receiver=None)`

`data`: a variable to be sent to all other nodes.
`receiver`: a string representing the id/public key of the node the message is for.
  If specified the message will be encrypted and only that node will be able to receive and read it.


  To receive messages simply extend the Node class:
    class Mynode(Node):
      def on_message(message, sender, private):
        # Gets called everytime there is a new message
    node = Mynode()
    node.start()

  `message`: variable sent from other node.
  `sender`: a string representing the id/public key of the node that snt the message.
  `private`: bool representing if the message was encrypted and meant only for this node or public.

  #### Other node properties:
    node.id : unique string identifying the node to the network, used to receive private messages.
### Files

`node.setfiledir(path)` sets the directory in which files downloaded from the net will be stored.

`node.addfile(path)` or `pythonp2p.files.addfile(path)`: Adds a file to the node so it can be requested by others.

  `path`: The absolute path of the file in the computer.
  This function returns the hash which can be used by other nodes to request the file.

`node.requestFile(filehash)`: Send a request to the network and if the file is available, download it.

  `filehash`: The hash of the file to request in string format. Look above on `addfile` to get that.


## Commands
If running node.py directly you will need this.
- `msg` - send a message to all other connected peers.
- `req`- request a file by hash
- `add` - adds a file by path to be downloaded by other node.
- `refresh` - refresh all files in content/ directory and get their hashes to share wit ohers. This hash is used above.
- `peers` - Get a list of known peers and connected peers. Also their last ping.
- `connect` - The most important command. Use `connect someip` to connect to a node and join the network.
- `debug` - Toggles debug mode. I suggest you leave this on to debug issues.
- `exit` - Stop all threads and exit.

# Features

- When a node connects no another it will recieve a list of active node to connect to.
- Deticated file downloader and servr. When a node requests a file by its hash it will connect
to a node that has it and download it. Files can be shared by placing them in a specified directory and
will be detectd with a refresh. This can be expanded to become like torrents.
- Peer discovery. Every node gets a list of neighbours when connected.
- Messages run he entire network, so every node can get every info out there.
  This is not very good for big networks but it works on a small scale and sending
  rate can be edited for scale.

- Nodes ping eahother and decide if a node is dead.
- more idk read the code

# Issues
- mostly security. Do not use this for production, only fiddling around.
  I am not responsible if you get hacked because of security vulnerabillities here.
